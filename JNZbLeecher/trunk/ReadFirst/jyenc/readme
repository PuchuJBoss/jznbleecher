This is jyenc, a decoder for the Usenet "yEnc" format,
licensed under the GNU General Public License.

The code is meant to be used by others to include support for yEnc encoded
files into their own projects. Code is provided to decode files from the
shell, but with minimum functionality. For more information on how to use it,
known bugs and the todo list, see the ar.com.ktulu.yenc.YEncDecoder
documentation in docs/index.html.

If you want to regenerate the documentation use "ant docs", for recompiling use
"ant" and "ant clean" to delete the class files and the documentation (you need
Ant installed for this to work). 

You can download jyenc's latest version from http://ktulu.com.ar/
